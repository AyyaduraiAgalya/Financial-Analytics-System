# AWS RDS Setup for Financial Analytics System

## Overview
This document outlines the general setup of the Amazon RDS instance used for the Integrated Financial Analytics System. It highlights the architectural and non-sensitive configurations tailored for a development environment, demonstrating data engineering and database management capabilities.

## Database Configuration
- **Database Engine**: PostgreSQL
- **Instance Type**: Chosen for general-purpose use, suitable for small to medium scale applications that require cost-effectiveness and moderate performance.
- **Storage**: Utilises general-purpose SSD storage to effectively balance cost and performance, appropriate for a development setting.

## Security and Network
- **Security Groups**: Configured to allow only essential traffic, enhancing database security while demonstrating best practices in network security management.
- **Connection Management**: All connections are managed through standard PostgreSQL connection mechanisms, ensuring robust security and authentication.

## Backup and Maintenance
- **Backups**: Currently, automatic backups are not enabled to minimise costs in this development environment. This setup is intended for demonstration purposes, and as such, data persistence is not prioritised. For a production environment, enabling RDS automatic backups and setting appropriate retention policies would be recommended.

## Usage Recommendations
- **Connecting to the Database**: Utilise standard PostgreSQL clients for database connections. Ensure all credentials are managed securely through environment variables or a secure credential store to protect access credentials effectively.
